## Ol√° mundo, this is Lucas! 

- Most of my time is spent working on 2 businesses that I built with my best friends.
- With the time that I have left, I try to work on a couple of personal ideas. Hopefully I can get some of them out now in this new era with AI coding assistants. It's becoming much easier to build things and validate fast.
- Oh, and I have to remind myself to go outdoors, exercise, make new friends, all that jazz is very important!
- Anyway, I hope you are having a nice day, thanks for visiting my profile :)

*These are the languages I've been messing around for the past 30 days.*
