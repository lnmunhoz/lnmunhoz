## Hey there, this is Lucas!

These are the languages I've been messing around for the past 30 days. Mostly I of my time is spent working on 2 businesses that I build with my best friends.
With the time that I have left, I try work on a couple of personal ideas, hopefully I can get some of them out now on this new era with AI coding assistants it becoming much easier to build things and validate fast.
Oh, and I have to remind myself to go outdoors, exercise, make new friends, all that jazz, is very important!
Anyway, have a nice day, thanks for visiting my profile :)
